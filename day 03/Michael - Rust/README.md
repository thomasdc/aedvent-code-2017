# Day 3: spiral

## Rust language
Read about the language, dependencies and how to compile programs here: https://www.rust-lang.org

## Quick Start
Once dependencies are installed, run:

 ```sh
  > rustc src\main.rs
  > main.exe
  ```

## Results
On my machine, this was the output:

### Part 1
 ```sh
The number 312051 is located 430 steps from the center.
Program took 0.015127226 seconds.
   ```

### Part 2
 ```sh
Ending on coord [0, 4]..
Next value larger than 312051 was: 312453.
Program took 0.003216591 seconds.
   ```
