AE Advent of Code 2017

This repository contains code submissions by AE employees for Advent of Code 2017 (Which will commence in December)
http://adventofcode.com

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

# AE Leaderboard

Here's our private leaderboard: http://adventofcode.com/2017/leaderboard/private/view/29328. The code can be found in the #aedvent slack channel.

# Folder Structure

Add your submission as `YourName - Language` in the directory for that day (example: `day 01/Joske - JavaScript`)

Any files which need to be ignored (IDE configuration settings) can be added to .gitignore in the root.
You can add a README.md to your folder for any run instructions / dependencies
