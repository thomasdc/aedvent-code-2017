# Day 4: passphrases

## Rust language
Read about the language, dependencies and how to compile programs here: https://www.rust-lang.org

## Quick Start
Once dependencies are installed, run:

 ```sh
   > rustc src\main.rs
   > main.exe
   ```

## Results
On my machine, this was the output:

### Part 1
 ```sh
Valid passphrases 451/512
Program took 0.024549239 seconds.
   ```

### Part 2
 ```sh
Valid passphrases 223/512
Program took 0.027889951 seconds.
   ```
